//! Socketioxide is a socket.io server implementation that works as a tower layer/service.
//! It integrates nicely with the rest of the [`tower`](https://docs.rs/tower/latest/tower/)/[`tokio`]/[`hyper`](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/) ecosystem.

//! ## Features
//! * Easy to use flexible axum-like API
//! * Fully compatible with the official [socket.io client](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/)
//! * Support for the previous version of the protocol (v4).
//! * State Management
//! * Namespaces
//! * Rooms
//! * Acknowledgements
//! * Common and Msgpack parsers
//! * Polling & Websocket transports
//!
//! ## Compatibility
//! Because it works as a tower [`layer`](tower_layer::Layer)/[`service`](tower_service::Service) or an hyper [`service`](hyper::service::Service)
//! you can use it with any http server frameworks that works with tower/hyper:
//! * [Axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/)
//! * [Warp](https://docs.rs/warp/latest/warp/) (Not supported with socketioxide >= 0.9.0 as long as warp doesn't migrate to hyper v1)
//! * [Hyper](https://docs.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/)
//! * [Salvo](https://docs.rs/salvo/latest/salvo/)
//!
//! Check the [examples](http://github.com/totodore/socketioxide/tree/main/examples) for
//! more details on frameworks integration.
//!
//! ## Usage
//! The API tries to mimic the equivalent JS API as much as possible.
//! The main difference is that the default namespace `/` is not created automatically,
//! you need to create it manually.
//!
//! #### Basic example with axum:
//! ```no_run
//! use axum::routing::get;
//! use socketioxide::{
//!     extract::SocketRef,
//!     SocketIo,
//! };
//! #[tokio::main]
//! async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//!     let (layer, io) = SocketIo::new_layer();
//!
//!     // Register a handler for the default namespace
//!     io.ns("/", |s: SocketRef| {
//!         // For each "message" event received, send a "message-back" event with the "Hello World!" event
//!         s.on("message", |s: SocketRef| {
//!             s.emit("message-back", "Hello World!").ok();
//!         });
//!     });
//!
//!     let app = axum::Router::new()
//!     .route("/", get(|| async { "Hello, World!" }))
//!     .layer(layer);
//!
//!     let listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:3000").await.unwrap();
//!     axum::serve(listener, app).await.unwrap();
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```
//! ## Initialisation
//! The [`SocketIo`] struct is the main entry point of the library. It is used to create
//! a [`Layer`](tower_layer::Layer) or a [`Service`](tower_service::Service).
//! Later it can be used as the equivalent of the `io` object in the JS API.
//!
//! When creating your [`SocketIo`] instance, you can use the builder pattern to configure it with the [`SocketIoBuilder`] struct.
//! * See the [`SocketIoBuilder`] doc for more details on the available configuration options.
//! * See the [`layer`] module doc for more details on layers.
//! * See the [`service`] module doc for more details on services.
//!
//! #### Tower layer example with custom configuration:
//! ```
//! use socketioxide::SocketIo;
//! let (layer, io) = SocketIo::builder()
//!     .max_payload(10_000_000) // Max HTTP payload size of 10M
//!     .max_buffer_size(10_000) // Max number of packets in the buffer
//!     .build_layer();
//! ```
//!
//! #### Tower _standalone_ service example with default configuration:
//! ```
//! use socketioxide::SocketIo;
//! let (svc, io) = SocketIo::new_svc();
//! ```
//!
//! ## Handlers
//! Handlers are functions or clonable closures that are given to the `io.ns`, the `socket.on` and the `socket.on_disconnect` fns.
//! They can be async or sync and can take from 0 to 16 arguments that implements the [`FromConnectParts`]
//! trait for the [`ConnectHandler`], the [`FromMessageParts`] for
//! the [`MessageHandler`] and the [`FromDisconnectParts`] for the [`DisconnectHandler`].
//! They are greatly inspired by the axum handlers.
//!
//! If they are async, a new task will be spawned for each incoming connection/message so it doesn't block the event management task.
//!
//! * Check the [`handler::connect`] module doc for more details on the connect handler and connect middlewares.
//! * Check the [`handler::message`] module doc for more details on the message handler.
//! * Check the [`handler::disconnect`] module doc for more details on the disconnect handler.
//! * Check the [`extract`] module doc for more details on the extractors.
//!
//! ## Extractors
//! Handlers params are called extractors and are used to extract data from the incoming connection/message. They are inspired by the axum extractors.
//! An extractor is a struct that implements the [`FromConnectParts`] trait for the [`ConnectHandler`]
//! the [`FromMessageParts`] for the [`MessageHandler`] and the
//! [`FromDisconnectParts`] for the [`DisconnectHandler`].
//!
//! They can be used to extract data from the context of the handler and get specific params. Here are some examples of extractors:
//! * [`Data`](extract::Data): extracts and deserialize from any receieved data, if a deserialization error occurs the handler won't be called:
//!     - for [`ConnectHandler`]: extracts and deserialize from the incoming auth data
//!     - for [`ConnectMiddleware`](handler::ConnectMiddleware): extract and deserialize from the incoming auth data.
//!       In case of error, the middleware chain stops and a `connect_error` event is sent.
//!     - for [`MessageHandler`]: extracts and deserialize from the incoming message data
//! * [`TryData`](extract::TryData): extracts and deserialize from the any received data but with a `Result` type in case of error:
//!     - for [`ConnectHandler`] and [`ConnectMiddleware`](handler::ConnectMiddleware): extracts and deserialize from the incoming auth data
//!     - for [`MessageHandler`]: extracts and deserialize from the incoming message data
//! * [`SocketRef`]: extracts a reference to the [`Socket`](socket::Socket)
//! * [`AckSender`]: Can be used to send an ack response to the current message event
//! * [`ProtocolVersion`]: extracts the protocol version of the socket
//! * [`TransportType`]: extracts the transport type of the socket
//! * [`DisconnectReason`](crate::socket::DisconnectReason): extracts the reason of the disconnection
//! * [`State`]: extracts a [`Clone`] of a state previously set with [`SocketIoBuilder::with_state`](crate::io::SocketIoBuilder).
//! * [`Extension`](extract::Extension): extracts a clone of the corresponding socket extension
//! * [`MaybeExtension`](extract::MaybeExtension): extracts a clone of the corresponding socket extension if it exists
//! * [`HttpExtension`](extract::HttpExtension): extracts a clone of the http request extension
//! * [`MaybeHttpExtension`](extract::MaybeHttpExtension): extracts a clone of the http request extension if it exists
//! * [`SocketIo`]: extracts a reference to the [`SocketIo`] handle
//!
//! ### Extractor order
//! Extractors are run in the order of their declaration in the handler signature.
//! If an extractor returns an error, the handler won't be called and a `tracing::error!` call
//! will be emitted if the `tracing` feature is enabled.
//!
//! For the [`MessageHandler`], some extractors require to _consume_ the event and therefore
//! only implement the [`FromMessage`](handler::FromMessage) trait.
//!
//! Note that any extractors that implement the [`FromMessageParts`] also implement by default
//! the [`FromMessage`](handler::FromMessage) trait.
//!
//! ## Events
//! There are three types of events:
//! * The connect event is emitted when a new connection is established. It can be handled with the
//!   [`ConnectHandler`] and the `io.ns` method.
//! * The message event is emitted when a new message is received. It can be handled with the
//!   [`MessageHandler`] and the `socket.on` method.
//! * The disconnect event is emitted when a socket is closed. It can be handled with the
//!   [`DisconnectHandler`] and the `socket.on_disconnect` method.
//!
//! Only one handler can exist for an event so registering a new handler for an event will replace the previous one.
//!
//! ## Middlewares
//! When providing a [`ConnectHandler`] for a namespace you can add any number of
//! [`ConnectMiddleware`](handler::ConnectMiddleware) in front of it. It is useful to add authentication or logging middlewares.
//!
//! A middleware *must* return a `Result<(), E> where E: Display`.
//! * If the result is `Ok(())`, the next middleware is called or if there is no more middleware,
//!   the socket is connected and the [`ConnectHandler`] is called.
//! * If the result is an error, the namespace connection will be refused and the error will be returned with a
//!   [`connect_error` event and a `message`](https://socket.io/docs/v4/middlewares/#handling-middleware-error) field with the error.
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//!     Because the socket is not yet connected to the namespace,
//!     you can't send messages to it from the middleware.
//! </div>
//!
//! See the [`handler::connect`](handler::connect#middleware) module doc for more details
//! on middlewares and examples.
//!
//! ## [Emiting data](#emiting-data)
//! Data can be emitted to a socket with the [`Socket::emit`](socket::Socket) method. It takes an event name and a data argument.
//! The data argument can be any type that implements the [`serde::Serialize`] trait.
//!
//! You can emit from the [`SocketIo`] handle or the [`SocketRef`].
//! The difference is that you can move the [`io`] handle everywhere because it is a cheaply cloneable struct.
//! The [`SocketRef`] is a reference to the socket and you should avoid storing it in your own code (e.g. in HashMap/Vec).
//! If you do so, you will have to remove the socket reference when the socket is disconnected to avoid memory leaks.
//!
//! Moreover the [`io`] handle can emit to any namespace while the [`SocketRef`] can only emit to the namespace of the socket.
//!
//! When using any `emit` fn, if you provide tuple-like data (tuple, arrays), it will be considered as multiple emit arguments.
//! If you send a vector it will be considered as a single argument.
//!
//! #### Emitting binary data
//! To emit binary data, you must use a data type that implements [`Serialize`] as binary data.
//! Currently if you use `Vec<u8>` it will be considered as a number sequence and not binary data.
//! To counter that you must either use a special type like [`Bytes`] or use the [`serde_bytes`] crate.
//! If you want to emit generic binary data, use [`rmpv::Value`] rather than [`serde_json::Value`] otherwise
//! the binary data will also be serialized as a number sequence.
//!
//! [`Serialize`]: serde::Serialize
//! [`serde_bytes`]: https://docs.rs/serde_bytes
//! [`Bytes`]: bytes::Bytes
//! [`rmpv::Value`]: https://docs.rs/rmpv
//! [`serde_json::Value`]: https://docs.rs/serde_json/latest/serde_json/value
//!
//! #### Emit errors
//! If the data can't be serialized, a [`ParserError`] will be returned.
//!
//! If the socket is disconnected or the internal channel is full, a [`SendError`] will be returned.
//! Moreover, a tracing log will be emitted if the `tracing` feature is enabled.
//!
//! #### Emitting with operators
//! To configure the emit, you can chain [`Operators`](operators) methods to the emit call. With that you can easily configure the following options:
//! * rooms: emit, join, leave to specific rooms
//! * namespace: emit to a specific namespace (only from the [`SocketIo`] handle)
//! * timeout: set a custom timeout when waiting for an ack
//! * binary: emit a binary payload with the message
//! * local: broadcast only to the current node (in case of a cluster)
//!
//! Check the [`operators`] module doc for more details on operators.
//!
//! ## Acknowledgements
//! You can ensure that a message has been received by the client/server with acknowledgements.
//!
//! #### Server acknowledgements
//! They are implemented with the [`AckSender`] extractor.
//! You can send an ack response with an optional binary payload with the [`AckSender::send`] method.
//! If the client doesn't send an ack id to respond to, the [`AckSender::send`] method will do nothing.
//!
//! #### Client acknowledgements
//! If you want to emit/broadcast a message and await for a/many client(s) acknowledgment(s) you can use:
//! * [`SocketRef::emit_with_ack`] for a single client
//! * [`BroadcastOperators::emit_with_ack`] for broadcasting or [emit configuration](#emiting-data).
//! * [`SocketIo::emit_with_ack`] for broadcasting to an entire namespace.
//!
//! [`SocketRef::emit_with_ack`]: crate::extract::SocketRef#method.emit_with_ack
//! [`BroadcastOperators::emit_with_ack`]: crate::operators::BroadcastOperators#method.emit_with_ack
//! [`SocketIo::emit_with_ack`]: SocketIo#method.emit_with_ack
//! [`AckStream`]: crate::ack::AckStream
//! [`ParserError`]: crate::parser::ParserError
//!
//! ## [State management](#state-management)
//! There are two ways to manage the state of the server:
//!
//! #### Per socket state
//! You can enable the `extensions` feature and use the [`extensions`](socket::Socket::extensions) field on any socket to manage
//! the state of each socket. It is backed by a [`RwLock<HashMap>>`](std::sync::RwLock) so you can safely access it
//! from multiple threads. However, the value must be [`Clone`] and `'static`.
//! When calling get, or using the [`Extension`](extract::Extension)/[`MaybeExtension`](extract::MaybeExtension) extractor,
//! the value will always be cloned.
//! See the [`extensions`] module doc for more details.
//!
//! #### Global state
//! You can enable the `state` feature and use [`SocketIoBuilder::with_state`](SocketIoBuilder) method to set
//! multiple global states for the server. You can then access them from any handler with the [`State`] extractor.
//!
//! The state is stored in the [`SocketIo`] handle and is shared between all the sockets. The only limitation is that all the
//! provided state types must be clonable.
//! Therefore it is recommended to use the [`Arc`](std::sync::Arc) type to share the state between the handlers.
//!
//! You can then use the [`State`] extractor to access the state in the handlers.
//!
//! ## Adapters
//! This library is designed to support clustering through the use of adapters.
//! Adapters enable broadcasting messages and managing socket room memberships across nodes
//! without requiring changes to your code. The [`Adapter`] trait abstracts the underlying system,
//! making it easy to integrate with different implementations.
//!
//! Adapters typically interact with third-party systems like Redis, Postgres, Kafka, etc.,
//! to facilitate message exchange between nodes.
//!
//! The default adapter is the [`LocalAdapter`], a simple in-memory implementation. If you intend
//! to use a different adapter, ensure that extractors are either generic over the adapter type
//! or explicitly specify the adapter type for each extractor that requires it.
//!
//! #### Write this:
//! ```
//! # use socketioxide::{SocketIo, adapter::Adapter, extract::SocketRef};
//! fn my_handler<A: Adapter>(s: SocketRef<A>, io: SocketIo<A>) { }
//! let (layer, io) = SocketIo::new_layer();
//! io.ns("/", my_handler);
//! ```
//! #### Instead of that:
//! ```
//! # use socketioxide::{SocketIo, adapter::Adapter, extract::SocketRef};
//! fn my_handler(s: SocketRef, io: SocketIo) { }
//! let (layer, io) = SocketIo::new_layer();
//! io.ns("/", my_handler);
//! ```
//!
//! Refer to the [README](https://github.com/totodore/socketioxide) for a list of available adapters and
//! the [examples](https://github.com/totodore/socketioxide/tree/main/examples) for detailed usage guidance.
//! You can also consult specific adapter crate documentation for more information.
//!
//! ## Parsers
//! This library uses the socket.io common parser which is the default for all the socket.io implementations.
//! Socketioxide also provided a msgpack parser. It is faster and more efficient than the default parser especially
//! for binary data or payloads with a lot of numbers.
//! To enable it, you must enable the [`msgpack`](#feature-flags) feature and then use the
//! [`with_parser`](SocketIoBuilder#method.with_parser) fn to set the parser to [`ParserConfig::msgpack`](ParserConfig#method.msgpack).
//!
//! ## [Feature flags](#feature-flags)
//! * `v4`: enable support for the socket.io protocol v4
//! * `tracing`: enable logging with [`tracing`] calls
//! * `extensions`: enable per-socket state with the [`extensions`] module
//! * `state`: enable global state management
//! * `msgpack`: enable msgpack custom parser
